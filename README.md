# caisse_enregistreuse_Adrien_Vennila
This package contains a script caisse.c where a user needs to pay bills. The amount to be paid will be given and the user will have to insert the money. If the amount inserted by the user is insufficient, then it will be asked over and over again to insert a new value until the amount is greater or equal than the amount to be paid. Afterwards, the amount to return the user will be displayed.
